* cheating?? jni.cpp 714

*** fast jni: doesn't use normal variables :)

*** 1052: "internal jni methods are called directly"

***** tuosta alkaa varsinainen bridge-koodi

* 1194 JNI defineclass not supported

* ideas for work load parameters

*** primitive vs. reference arguments

***** primitive vs. object arrays

******* accessing
"Because the underlying garbage collector may not support
pinning, the virtual machine may return a pointer to a copy of
the original primitive array."

***** strings

******* converting strings manually: account for it!
"Because the Java virtual machine implementation needs to allocate
memory to hold the UTF-8 string, there is a chance that memory
allocation will fail."

***** field access

*** primitive vs. reference return types

*** how to bypass jnienv &c. creation

*** JNI callbacks
